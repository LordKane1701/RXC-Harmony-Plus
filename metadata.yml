# Version 0.1 
# New troop enhancment options
# Elerium Flares (Starving Poet)
# PS1 Music (n7kopper)
# soldier Armor changes!
# 
# Version 1.0 RC1
# Made fully modular! no longer requires its own copy of Harmony! 
# Interceptors give 4 hardpoints (3 Medium + 1 small)
# Labs are given a slight bonus to healing injured troops you still will need the other medical facililites, but it will help! 
# Radars and Hyperwaves have slight increases to range and detection chance and now have the ability to sight alien bases! 
# Tanks have a health boost (armor and damage remains the same)
# Base Defense Turrets have a health boost as well! (armor and damage remain the same)
# soldier Armor changes reverted as I am going to be re-evaluating what exactly I want to accomplish and want to do here but in short:
# the more specialist armors (PSI,NightOps etc.) are being left alone.
# initial changes to starting heavy armor not as heavy slightly more protection (very slight)
#
# Version 1.0.A 
# Interdictor hardpoints change
